                                Art for peace was a 4 days workshop program which ended with an art exhibition on Friday May 26 held at CAVIC. The projectâ€™s primary objective is to make a substantive contribution to the fulfillment of sustainable development goals in Nigeria by harnessing the transformative power of the arts through the training and empowerment of affected teenagers. The workshop aims to help them overcome obstacles and create a brighter future while safeguarding against radicalization in the ECOWAS region. Participants for the workshop were selected from areas heavily impacted by conflicts, warfare, and socio-economic marginalization.Through the medium of arts and crafts, the workshop aimed to prevent radicalization and foster peace and unity across affected communities.  </div>
