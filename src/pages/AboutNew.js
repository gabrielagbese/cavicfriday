                    <p className='ab-segment-writing'>There are currently few services available to up and coming artists and few platforms that allow or provide them with start-up support or enable them to link up with other artists in similar situations.  In a city such as Abuja where rents are exorbitant and many artists arrive with just their talents and their tools, finding the space, support and networks that enable them to express and grow that talent is oftentimes impossible, leading to a stunting of creative expression.</p>
